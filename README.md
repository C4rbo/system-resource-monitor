# System Resource Monitor

This Bash script monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage on a Linux system, logging high-usage warnings to a file (`monitor.log`). It runs continuously in the background, checking resource usage at specified intervals and generating log reports.

## Features
- **Monitors CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage**: Tracks system usage levels and logs them.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set usage thresholds to control when warnings are logged.
- **Interval Control**: Adjust the frequency of resource checks.
- **Graceful Exit**: Handles exit signals, ensuring the script stops cleanly.

## Requirements
- Linux or WSL environment.
- `bc` package for calculating CPU and memory percentages.
- Basic command-line utilities like `top`, `free`, and `df`.

## Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/C4rbo/system-resource-monitor.git
    cd system-resource-monitor
    ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x script.sh
    ```

3. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./script.sh
    ```
    The script will start checking resource usage and outputting logs to `monitor.log`.

## Customization
- **CPU, Memory, and Disk Thresholds**:
    - Adjust these variables in the script:
        ```bash
        CPU_THRESHOLD=80
        MEMORY_THRESHOLD=90
        DISK_THRESHOLD=90
        ```
    - Change them as needed (percentages).
- **Interval Between Checks**:
    - Modify the `INTERVAL` variable in the script to set the frequency of resource checks (in seconds):
        ```bash
        INTERVAL=7
        ```

## Logs
All log entries are written to `monitor.log` in the scriptâ€™s directory, including timestamped entries and warnings when any resource threshold is exceeded.

## Stopping the Script
To stop the script, press `CTRL+C`, and it will gracefully exit with a message.
